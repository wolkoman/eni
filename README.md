## Description
A web-platform for the catholic parish "Emmaus am Wienerberg" in Vienna, Austria. It serves a variety of functionality, including but not limited to:
- the display of events in a Google calendar
- suggesting changes to those events
- upload, display and automatic sending of the weekly newsletter
- system to organize duties in liturgies

## Getting started
For the moment, development happens against production data. So one needs access to the [doppler](https://www.doppler.com) to have a meaningful development environment. Contact Manuel @wolkoman. If you have access, perform the following commands:
1. `doppler login`
2. `doppler setup`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
